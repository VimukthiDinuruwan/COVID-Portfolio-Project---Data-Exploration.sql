ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Data Cleaning Portfolio Project

Description:
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis. Using SQL queries, the dataset was transformed into a more structured and reliable format. The goal was to ensure consistency, accuracy, and usability of the data for downstream analysis.

Key Steps:

Removed duplicate records to prevent skewed results.

Standardized inconsistent text fields (e.g., names, categories, dates).

Handled missing/null values appropriately.

Reformatted date and numeric columns for proper querying.

Created clean, analysis-ready tables.

Skills Demonstrated:
UPDATE, ALTER, DELETE, TRIM, JOIN, CASE WHEN, CTEs (Common Table Expressions).

ðŸ“Œ Project 2: COVID Data Exploration Project

Description:
This project explores global COVID-19 data to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to cases, deaths, and vaccinations. SQL queries were used to perform data exploration, calculate metrics, and highlight key observations.

Key Steps:

Analyzed infection and death rates across different countries.

Compared vaccination rollout progress regionally and globally.

Calculated percentage of population infected and vaccinated.

Used advanced SQL features like CTEs and window functions to generate running totals and moving averages.

Created queries to answer real-world analytical questions.

Skills Demonstrated:
SELECT, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, CTEs, Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, SUM OVER), Aggregations.
